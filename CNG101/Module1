What is an advantage of using a Server? (only 1 question for 1st vid)
Draw a picture of the difference between p2p and c/s
What makes an “administrator” special?
What’s nice about p2p networks? @0:58

Objective: Describe how IP addresses are assigned and formatted.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUZohsAxPxQ 7 min PieterExplainsTech
Intro: DHCP is the way addresses are assigned, so basically all you need to be able to do is describe how DHCP works 
and you can do that by identifying and elaborating on each of the 4 steps dhcp takes to establish an ip address! 
Questions: 
Why is manual ip address allocation a bad idea?
What does broadcast mean?
What is port 68/67 reserved for?
What does a DHCP ack message mean?
MyNotes
-DHCP has a 4 step process
-routers usually have a dhcp server built in
-step 3 is DHCP request

Objective: Solve a networking problem using the seven-step troubleshooting model. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3C4vfL-mis 
Intro: This video may have low camera quality but I really like this guys presentation style and at the end of the day all you have to do is know these 7 steps, and try your best to implement them once you get an IT job. 
Questions
What is step 1, why is this an important step to reflect on?
Why is a low impact quick fix important?
What is step 3, where would you go to get this?
Step 5 is my favorite, what is it and what is “being tested?”
Step 6 is escalate, why are some IT professionals hesitant to use this step?
MyNotes
-gather as much info as you can with step 1
-step 2 try a quick fix! 
-step 4 is Comparisons (especially with past vs present)
-Step 7 Document and automate! 

Objective: Describe current network addressing.
Crash Course! Networking lesson https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QhU9jd03a0 12min
Questions
What is a collision?
What is ethernet?
Why is a random time interval used when a computer is waiting for the noise on a carrier to die down?

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeArDrC2xPg prof messer 13min
Objective:  List the purposes and properties of routing.
Intro: To better wrap your mind around routers, and the concept of routing tables I’ve brought in a witty video from Prof. Messer. This is a great lesson to watch after all my subnetting lessons! We get to digest the router code a little bit more now, without looking at code! 
Questions: 
What is an example of a layer 3 device?
What is a hop?
What is a hop limit? 
What is a loopback address?
What is a routing table?
What command can you type to view a routing table? 

Obj: Implement TCP/IP utilities for network discovery and troubleshooting.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1neBj0WeX0 Jacob Morrison (really good! Dry but good!) 19 min
Intro: I like that this guy points out right away that you will be on the command line. Today we will do exactly what the obj is referring to, discover other computers on a network, and you’ll learn some command to troubleshoot any problems you may run into.
Questions
How do you open up the command line in Windows?
What cmd gives you more information for ipconfig?
How do you ask the dhcp server for a new ip address?
What does the ping command do?
MyNotes
-In an “enterprise” (meaning business) environment your router and gateway may be different, but typically you only have one router in your home environment
-while waiting for a computer to come up, rather than typing ping every 5 minutes you can type ping -t and it’ll ping continuously and you can stare or check that screen periodically if the machine is back up. To stop this command running forever just type ctrl C

Obj: Implement TCP/IP utilities for network discovery and troubleshooting.

Intro- Part 2 of this lesson this type we focus on the troubleshooting portion of the objective. Here we are going to troubleshoot an internet outage problem...
Questions:
What is a DNS cache?
How do you find out what DNS server you are using?
What is the problem that needed troubleshooting in this lesson? What were some strategies the speaker used to solve the problem?

MyNotes
-how do you fix a DNS cache problem (in the case that your computer is trying to access an older version of a particular website) 
-why ping one of the DNS servers? To see if it’s alive! If it is, then verifying it works will help you move on to find what the problem could be, unless you need to change the ip address of your DNS.

What would the console access go to? 
Let’s look into the software now, what is the default way to assign an IP address?
What does VLAN stand for? 
MyNotes
-12 chips 1 for each port 
-the fans are thermal activated
- lol @ the fingerprints that came with the switch! 
-you can name the ports whatever you want, for example port 4 can be the “wifi” port
-what’s the difference between uplink and downlink, I assume down is closer to the source… downriver? 

Objective: List the purposes and properties of routing

Objective:  List the purposes and properties of routing. 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPHjckRcTKo Prof Messer 15min
Intro- a “basic” video from Prof. Messer who does a good job at giving you the purpose of routing. Lots of key words to be mindful here. 
Questions:
How does the router know what to do with traffic?
What is IGP and EGP?
BGP is the default protocol for the internet, what does this stand for?
What is “the next hop?”
MyNotes
-RFC 1930 (clearly defined routing policy)
-Interior and Exterior gateway protocols
-RIP, EIGRP, RIPv2, needs to all get along and BGP does that. 
-the lower the metric, the more likely we’ll use that route. It’s like a “ranking” system so the lower the # the more significant

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHrGresKu2w Powershell for beginners 27min
Objective: Solve network address issues using command-line tools.
Intro: Skip to the 4min mark, his intro is not for us. 
Question:
What three services look interesting to you?
What is an example of a parameter?
What is an alias?
When we are sharing “scripts” with eachother, what is a potential problem? (16:26)
What do you type to get a specific process, lets say “MicrosoftEdge”
What does pushing up arrow do?  What does pipe ( | ) mean?
What’s the difference between method and property?
MyNotes
-right click > properties. To customize, make sure quickEdit mode is on so you can copy/paste
-get-command -Noun service
-this guy doesn’t like alias? Ok I suppose this is understandable. I like just typing “get-alias” to see all the commands I can use
-to create a variable you can type “$zebra = Get-Process MicrosoftEdge
Then type $zebra to make the thing happen 
Cool use of methods $zebra.kill() 
Get-Help is such an important command so get-help start-Transcript -ex will give examples :)

Objective: Solve network address issues using command-line tools.

Intro: In Networking you’ll need to use scripts from time to time so today will give you an example of how to break a script down, very useful and a great beginners lesson as well. Throughout these powershell video’s it will be VERY helpful for you to type in these commands yourself. It’s like practice basketball, you don’t just practice by watching others play, though that’s a part of getting better, you practice by dribbling and shooting yourself. So shoot the ball! 
Keep this original Script here so you can see his back and forth from the alias definitions:
Get-PSDrive | ?{$_.Free -gt 1} | %{$Count = 0; Write-Host “ “‘} {#_.Name + "{0:N2}" -f ($_.Used/1gb) + " Free: " + "{0:N2}" -f ($_.free/1gb) + " Total: " + "{0:N2}" -f (($_.Used/1gb)+($_.Free/1gb)); $Count = $Count + $_.Free;}{Write-Host"";Write-Host "Total Free Space " ("{0:N2}" -f ($Count/1gb)) -backgroundcolor magenta}
Questions
Get-PSDrive does what?
Select-Object * 
ForEach-Object
MyNotes
-What is a ?... it means where-object
-get-alias ? will help you answer this
