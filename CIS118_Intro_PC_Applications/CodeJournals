#Yesterday I learned about the urllib library where modules such as urlopen exist. Once I "open" a url, lots of data is stored in a variable
#and I can manipulate that data in a variety of ways like read the response code and determine the length. 

import urllib
from urllib request
var = request.urlopen("...")
