Learning Outcome: Define the basic hardware and software concepts associated with personal computers
Objective: Identify connections between the ability to program & the ability to solve problems
Questions
Why’s it important for you to identify if you are in the zone or not? ESPECIALLY when learning about software? 
Why is precision important to a programming language?
Why do programming languages look so intimidating?
What is an algorithm? 
What’s the difference between low and high level programming? 
T/F can there be a variety of algorithms created to solve the same problem? 
Answers
So you don’t get freaked out or frustrated.
The content being displayed on your screen must be precisely what the user wanted.
Those 3 concepts make programming intimidating. Precision, predictability, and unique (strange) terms all lend to the “scary” nature of programming.
Variety
True

DOL: 
Two programmers walk into a job. 
One tells the computer to: sort the list alphabetically and the built in functions of the language she chose, converts this to machine code.
The second tells the computer to take the first name and compare it to the second. If the first letter is lower then put that name first. If they are the same, check the second letter. 
Which programmer used a higher level language?

What type of arduino is good for a breadboard? 

Answer:
Digtal pins
Analog pins & power pins
It means we have a zero, high would mean we have a one. 
It means we can create a pwm signal, which means we can adjust it’s brightness.
Darker
arduino nano is good for a breadboard

What material are these “tracks” made of on a motherboard?
Why isn’t it smart to drill your own holes in a (pcb)motherboard?
What is a substrate?
Answers
To connect an xbox wireless controller to a n64
Pcb is made using fiberglass and copper 
A first attempt or first step in making something. So rough draft!
A device for reading 10s off a wire so we can see what signals the controller is sending, without permission from microsoft or nintendo. Maybe the data is out there already, but if not we an use one of these.
A microcontroller is like an all in one device, both the processor and the ram and sometimes other things are on a single chip. This is usually good for small scale computer building also known as embedded systems.
4 pins, which can handle megabits or even gigabits of data per second. Just these 4 pins! Now according to google: Two pins are used for power and two pins are used for differential data transmission.
Red is power, black is ground and white is data.
So we can get the components to talk to each other efficiently, but also, in a small space.
Copper
 You could go through a trace! And ruin the whole board
Substrate is a layer

Intro: We'll talk about how large programs are typically broken up into into function units that are nested into objects known as Object Oriented Programming, as well as how programmers write and debug their code efficiently, document and share their code with others, and also how code repositories are used to allow programmers to make changes while mitigating risk.  

Objective: Describe how programs, or software, is built
Questions:
How many lines of code does Microsoft Office have? 
What are “functions” relation to “objects?” Use ex. If you’d like.
What is abstraction?
Why is documentation important?
What is an api? 
Answers
40 Million! (more than)
Objects have many functions, and variables are used by functions.
Abstraction is a way to view complex systems, we don’t worry about the tiny details above or below
Documentation is important because code is usually developed in teams
An api will give the right access between objects
