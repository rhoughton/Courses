Intro: If you liked the intro video to binary from Kevin Drumm, he takes no time in getting really compllicated in this follow up video. I like 2s complement, its a great example of a nifty trick computer scientist used to represent negative numbers. Why does he say “do the maths,” well English speakers from New Zealand, or Australia like to say “maths” instead of “math” like we do in America, but it means the same thing! That phrase tripped me up in the beginning I thought it might be like, more complicated.

Why is this a useful way to represent negative numbers?
Convert -6 into 8 bit binary (this just means your left most bit is 1) so you have 7 to work with.

So 64+32 is 96 thus, that value kept popping up everywhere. Now 96 is my favorite linemen number!

-Boost clock is interesting, it can speed the card up depending on what’s going on
-Nvidia’s custom programming language = CUDA and they talk about the # of CUDA cores in a gpu b/c the language will utilize this number… I’ve written some CUDA and it can be embedded in a c++ file, if you use __global__ you’ll basically command the computer to utilize the gpu to execute the code instead of the cpu

Name two chips that are 7nm small.
------myNotes---------
-intel’s 10nm chip is denser than the 7nm chip so, be careful with these numbers
-Intel is targeting the low power market with Foveros, 1st chip is called LakeField
Answers
Some features of a cpu, so not a transistor, but still that’s interestingly small. To think these companies are engineering with that size in mind is crazy!
Chip!
Animation and gaming utilizes one core at a time sometimes so, it matters.
The idea that multiple chips (chiplets) can work together and if one goes bad there is a backup.
Everything is built on a continuous piece of silicon. (mono = one)
