Conceal
I like the time stamps he provides in the about section, just looking at those here are some thoughts:
- IKE stands for internet key exchange, which sets up security via the ipsec protocol suite. *watch my video on IKE & ipsec*
-uses juicyPotato to escalate
Questions
@3:14 After using snmpwalk, what did we see the system give us right away? (hint* what is snmpwalk used for?)
He took this preshared key and piped it into wc -c, what was the output?
Why is he checking the windows build?
What is IIS?
What results come back when he runs an ike-scan -M
@17:06 What are the VIDs listed below the SA (security association)?
What is pfSense? @20:20
What is a common extension for windows? @28:00
What are the last two puts he uses to root the box? @1:25:31
While sitting in the documents folder, what is his final command?

IKE VPN password psk (pre-shared key)

To look for vulnerabilities, notes on “build:” Windows has always used build numbers. They represent significant updates to Windows. Traditionally, most people have referred to Windows based on the major, named version they’re using—Windows Vista, 7, 8, and so on. Within those versions, we also had service packs to refer to: Windows 7 Service Pack 1
Windows Version of Apache, it’s a server
Ike-scan -M (for multi-line) delivers lots of info but the interesting part is everything about the VPN. Ippsec broke this down into multiple parts including the connection between PSK and what he learned the PSK was earlier (Dudecake1).
These are vendor IDs they are fingerprints, hashes that get looked up. We have win8 fingerprint which just means it’s probably a win8 vpn box. Ultimately this gives us the clue that it’s IKE version 1
pfsense is an openBSD based firewall

--myNotes/Command-along---
-snmpwalk, snmp-check, ike-scan, nmap -p- (does all ports)
-nmap -sU (covers all udp ports)
-hashes.org is a good site (kraken is good to) and searched for this pre shared key, where we discovered this value is an md5 for dudegate1
-he then used “snmp-check 10.10.10.116” to see port 500 open (udp)
-he ends up not saying much @5:30 about the OS Build but if you deeper dive into each build you can read Microsoft knowledge base articles to learn what the updates in that build did…
-the destination ip of 0.0.0.0 is also known as a quad-zero route and is the default route, so thus it receives an all zero mask
-127.0.0.1 does have a 255.255.255.255 mask
-uPNP is 1900 and can be abused.
-man ipsec.secrets - secrets for IKE/IPsec authentication
-the authentication type is PSK?
-the IKE key is 3des, sha1, modp1024
-leftprotoport = tcp
-nmap -sT gives us the open port we are looking for via 445, this is because nmap defaults to a sins scan 
-Now the real fun begins! @27:00
Ftp 10.10.10.116
Put test.txt
To see if this works just type in the url with a \upload\test.txt
-after his final command executing the cmd.exe he types in whoami and gets a “nt authority\system response
-the machine was just put in a weird state so cmd.exe wasn’t working, but now the alpc exploit is working
